This project implements a basic tally counter using a Redux like state management system. The state consists of a tally value that starts at 0. The ADD action increments the tally, SUBTRACT decrements it and RESET sets it back to 0. The store has methods to get the state, do actions and subscribe to state changes logging the state to the console each time. My main challenge was ensuring each action correctly updated the state. This was handled by using a simple reducer function which takes the current state and an action and returns a new state based on what action it was. To run the code I added an index.html file simply open it in the browser and view the state changes in the console. I could have made the code more modular, maintainable and scalable by splitting up the code into different javaScript files such as store.js, reducer.js, actions.js and main.js but since this was a very small project I figured it would be okay.
